# Kerberos Enterprise

Over the years Kerberos evolved into a mature and stable solution. Lots of people and companies started to adopt the system, and requested enhancements. Despite the fact that Kerberos Open Source is stable and feature rich, every solution has its limitations, especially if you aim to scale it.

That being said, Kerberos Open Source is perfect when monitoring a limited set of surveillance cameras, but it doesn't scale well if you plan to monitor dozens or hundreds of surveillance cameras. Although Kerberos Open Source ships as a docker image, it has no high availability or fail over functionality. Due to these reasons we have developed Kerberos Enterprise, which is suitable for scaling against your ever growing video surveillance landscape, and keeps them up and running in whatever situation.

## Installation
